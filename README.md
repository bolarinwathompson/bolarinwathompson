<h2>üë®‚Äçüíª Data Science Projects:</h2>

- <b>Regression Tree - Basic Template</b>
  - [This project uses a Decision Tree Regressor to predict continuous outcomes, exploring model accuracy and overfitting.](https://github.com/bolarinwathompson/project11)
- <b>Random Forest for Regression</b>
  - [This project applies Random Forest Regressor to predict customer loyalty scores, evaluating model performance using R-squared, Adjusted R-squared, and cross-validation.](https://github.com/bolarinwathompson/Random-Forest-for-Regression)
- <b>PCA and Random Forest Classifier</b>
  - [This project demonstrates the use of PCA for dimensionality reduction followed by training a Random Forest Classifier to predict target variables.](https://github.com/bolarinwathompson/project3)
- <b>K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for Advanced Classification</b>
  - [This project uses the KNN algorithm to classify customer data, with performance evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix visualizations.](https://github.com/bolarinwathompson/project5)
- <b>Random Forest for Regression - ABC Grocery</b>
  - [This project applies Random Forest for regression, evaluating customer loyalty score predictions, and includes feature importance analysis and permutation importance.](https://github.com/bolarinwathompson/project6)
- <b>Advanced K-Means Clustering</b>
  - [This project performs K-Means clustering on customer data to segment them into groups based on purchasing behaviour, using the Elbow Method for optimal cluster selection.](https://github.com/bolarinwathompson/K-Means-Clustering-Project)
- <b>Causal Impact Analysis</b>
  - [This project uses CausalImpact to evaluate the effectiveness of a marketing campaign on customer sales, comparing pre- and post-campaign periods.](https://github.com/bolarinwathompson/Causal-impact-analysis-project)
- <b>Association Rule Learning for ABC Grocery</b>
  - [This project applies the Apriori algorithm to discover associations between products purchased together by customers in ABC grocery store transactions.](https://github.com/bolarinwathompson/Association-Rule-Learning-Project- )
- <b>A/B Testing for ABC Grocery</b>
  - [This project uses A/B testing technique to determine if there is a statistically significant relationship between different mailer types and customer sign-up rates.](https://github.com/bolarinwathompson/A-B-Testing-Project-)

- <b>Artificial Neural Network - Video Game Success Prediction</b>
  - [This project applies an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict the success of video games, training the model on game features and evaluating its performance.](https://github.com/bolarinwathompson/Artificial-Neural-Network-Project)

- <b>Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) - Image Search Engine Project</b>
  - [This project builds an image search engine using VGG16 to extract features from images and finds similar images based on cosine similarity.](https://github.com/bolarinwathompson/Convolutional-Neural-Network1)
   
- <b>Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) - Fruit Classification Project</b>
  - [This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of fruits for ABC Grocery. The model successfully predicts the category of a fruit in a new image.](https://github.com/bolarinwathompson/Convolutional-Neural-Network-)
